What is render_template? (app.py)
Does {% %} indicate the use of python within html? (model_tmplt.html)

Flask is configuring the Jinja2 template engine for you

Predictions:

Q0: If you remove the render_template flask will not import the package that is uses to render templates, you will not be able to use the render_template() method

Q1: The url will http://localhost:5000//my_foist_template

Q2: a. The template to render is indicated as 'model_tmplt.html' (it will be searched for in the template folder
b. The variable foo is assigned the value of "fooooo"
c. collection = coll is used to indicate that that within the python %for item in collection% the collection is specified as the list coll

Corrections:

Q0: loading the page at localhost:5000//my_foist_template caused an internal server error (because of the package not being imported)
