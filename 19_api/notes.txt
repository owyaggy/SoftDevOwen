K19 -- API basics
2021-11-23

- JSON packages are like dictionaries and can be opened in browser
- count=1 can be added to the NASA api request to get it to return 1 random image,
  rather than the image from the day of the request
- the json including the image also includes a date from which the image was featured
- if count=1 is used, the json is a list of dictionaries, meaning it must be accessed
  using an index before any data can be extracted for it (hence the use of [0] in our code)
