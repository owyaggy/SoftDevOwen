JavaScript notes:
- Semicolons are good practice and important
- console.log outputs to console like a print statement
- Instead of f strings, use `this is text, 2*2 is ${variable}, this is text`
- Because JavaScript runs in browser, it can access html through `document`
- document body can be modified by editing classes, items, or adding elements to body

While
    function gcd(a, b) {...}
is a valid way to write function in JavaScript, defining them like
    let gcd = function gcd(a, b) {...}
allows for greater functionality (the extent of which is not fully clearâ€¦)
