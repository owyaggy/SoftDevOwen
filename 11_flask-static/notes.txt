2021-10-06

Observations for app.py:
- app.py runs the same as v4 from K10
- using `$ flask run` in the terminal prints "app" as the name of the file of the python file
- using `$ python3 app.py` in the app's directory displays "__main__" as the name of the file 

Observations for foo:
- booting up localhost:5000 prompted FireFox to download the .txt file
- the file ending serves only as a wrapper and helps the operating system determine what application should be used to open the file
- cat FILENAME allows you to quickly determine the contents of a file, you can also open it with an editor

Observations for foo.html:
- booting up localost:5000 loaded the contents of foo.html as a webpage
