time spent: 0.7

* Modeling with a tabular database
1. Define Schema
2. Develop application and queries
- Data dictates application
- Have to work around data
- Have to restructure, lowering performance

* Modeling with MongoDB
1. Develop application
2. Define data model
3. Improve application -- continually -- > --
4. Improve data model  -- continually -- > --

* Key Considerations
- Data model defined at application level
- Design part of each phase of application lifetime
- Data model affected by application needs

* Step-by-step iteration
1. Evaluate application workload
2. Map out entities and their relationships
3. Finalize the data model for each collection

* Linking vs. embedding
- Relationships:
 - One-to-one
 - One-to-many
 - Many-to-many

* Design patterns
- Schema versioning pattern: add a field for schema version so you can handle different schema versions appropriately
- Batch updater will update data to new schema

- The Bucket Pattern
 - Tabular Approach: new document for each sensor reading
 - Document Approach: new document per time unit per sensor
