EGO
- cognitive dissonance caused by writing one's programs independently makes it harder to find and resolve problems
- when more people understand code, it is easier for them to see if it is achieving its goal and identify problems
- it is important not to see flaws in a program as attacks on oneself; the solution is to work (egolessly) with others
